Happy New Years! 2070, huh. Time flies by quickly. Now that we're celebrating a new year, and you're one step closer 
to adulthood, I think it's time for you to leave the underworld. Get a little taste of the outside world, if you will. 
Chances are though, if you're reading this, you'll definitely know where you're headed. Haha. You're on Earth! I know how much you've always
to visit the surface and so, as your father, I'm allowing you to get experience this place firsthand - you can probably imagine how 
upset your mother is right now. She's never been fond of adventure, hm? So anyway. This place isn't actually as magnificent as you thought it'd
be. As you may have noticed, the Earth has been tainted. Tainted by harmful chemicals, pollutants and ignorance. I've sent you here on a mission,
son: you need to cleanse the Earth of its filth. Mortals have never been capable of much, and so now is your chance to shine. Using your magical 
abilities from the underworld, eradicate any harm that comes in both your way, and the Earth's. Maybe you'll learn some new powers along the way?
For now, I've given you a radar that displays the amount of potential threats in your proximity. Be sure to eliminate everything before you carry
onto the next area. There's five total locations for you to explore, and their sizes gradually increase as you advance. Oh, and, one more thing. DON'T HURT YOURSELF. Although us reapers are immortal, we react very extremely to these entities on Earth.
If you do hurt yourself though, no worries. Just note that when I send you back to Earth, it isn't really the best feeling. 

Good luck out there!
